## 🧩 Problem Statement
India generates over 62 million tons of waste annually, yet much of it remains unmanaged or mismanaged.  
Lack of awareness, tools, and incentives leads to poor disposal habits, environmental pollution, and health hazards.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a mobile application that makes waste reduction engaging, educational, and accessible — enabling users to understand their habits, track improvements, and find sustainable alternatives easily.
